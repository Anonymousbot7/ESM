# Inference for Deep Neural Network Estimators in Generalized Nonparametric Models

This repository contains the implementation of our methods in **Python**. 

Sklearn version: 1.7.0

Torch version: 2.6.0+cu118

NumPy version: 1.26.4

## Structure

- **`simulations/`**  
  Contains all codes and packages for simulation studies.

- **`realdata/`**  
  Real data analysis. The algorithms are similar to those used in the simulations.

## Notes

- All workflows are organized into sequential scripts (see README inside `simulations/` and `realdata/` for details).  
- The real data used in this study are publicly available from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/) upon completion of a data use agreement and approval through the PhysioNet credentialed access process.
